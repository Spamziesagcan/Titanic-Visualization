# Titanic Visualization Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset through data visualization and analysis. It aims to uncover patterns related to survival rates, age distribution, passenger classes, and more, using a combined view of both the training and test datasets.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `TitanicVisualization.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing the data exploration, visualizations, and findings.
- `train.csv` — Training dataset containing labeled data (Survived/Not Survived).
- `test.csv` — Test dataset used for further analysis.
- `Titanic_Findings_Report.pdf` — PDF summary of key findings from the analysis.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Survival, class, fare, and age are strongly correlated.
- Median age of passengers was between 22–26 years.
- Class 1 passengers were predominantly wealthier.
- Women had a higher survival rate compared to men.
- The majority of passengers were aged 20–35 years.
